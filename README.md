OpenFunnels is a self-hosted, open-source funnel builder for creating, publishing, and improving conversion journeys while keeping customer data under your control.

It combines a visual page editor with lead-capture forms, a lightweight CRM, attribution analytics, A/B experiments, custom domains, portable templates, and optional AI-assisted drafts. The application is built on Laravel, Inertia, React, and TypeScript.

## Quick Start With Docker

The evaluation stack is the fastest way to try OpenFunnels. It requires Docker with Compose v2.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aialvi/openfunnels.git
cd openfunnels
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and select **Launch Demo**. You can also register a persistent local account.

The stack includes the web application, queue worker, scheduler, compiled frontend, and a persistent SQLite volume. It is intended for local evaluation—not production—and does not configure TLS, a reverse proxy, or custom-domain infrastructure.

```bash
# Follow service logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop without deleting local data
docker compose down

# Remove the stack and its local data
docker compose down --volumes
```

See the [Docker evaluation guide](docs/docker-evaluation.md) for more details.

## What You Can Build

- **Funnels:** Create pages with a drag-and-drop section, column, and block editor; undo and redo changes; autosave; and preview responsive layouts.
- **Templates:** Start from 15 categorized layouts or import and export versioned `.openfunnels.json` template packs.
- **Forms and contacts:** Capture configurable and conditional fields, preserve every submission, collect UTM and referrer attribution, manage lead statuses and notes, and export filtered contact segments to CSV.
- **Publishing:** Publish to slug-based URLs or verified custom domains, preview drafts, and unpublish without deleting content.
- **Analytics and experiments:** Track privacy-conscious events, conversion trends, traffic sources, drop-off, and stable A/B variant assignments.
- **Operations:** Send new-lead email notifications or webhooks, recover offline editor changes, and export to several web and commerce targets.
- **AI-assisted drafts:** Optionally generate funnel drafts through a provider-neutral, Responses-compatible backend driver.
- **Guest evaluation:** Run isolated, expiring demo accounts with outbound and administrative actions restricted.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- PHP 8.3 or later, with the extensions required by Laravel
- Composer 2
- Node.js 22 (the version used in CI and the Docker build)
- pnpm 10.13.1
- SQLite

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aialvi/openfunnels.git
cd openfunnels

composer install
corepack enable
pnpm install

cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate --seed
```

For local URL generation, set `APP_NAME=OpenFunnels` and `APP_URL=http://localhost:8000` in `.env`.

Start Laravel, the queue listener, log tailing, and Vite together:

```bash
composer run dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The seeded development account is:

```text
Email: test@example.com
Password: password
```

The seed account is for local development only. You can skip `--seed` and register your own account instead; with the default log mailer, email verification links are written to `storage/logs/laravel.log`.

To run the application and frontend separately:

```bash
php artisan serve
pnpm run dev
```

## Configuration

The default `.env.example` uses SQLite, database-backed queues, sessions and cache, and the log mailer. These optional variables enable additional features:

| `DOMAIN_MAPPING_CNAME_TARGET`     | `cname.openfunnels.com` | Expected CNAME target during domain verification |
| `DOMAIN_MAPPING_A_RECORD_IP`      | empty                   | Optional accepted A-record address               |

| `FUNNEL_AI_ENDPOINT`              | OpenAI Responses API    | Responses-compatible generation endpoint         |
| `FUNNEL_AI_API_KEY`               | empty                   | Server-side generation credential                |
| `FUNNEL_AI_MODEL`                 | `gpt-5.6-luna`          | Model sent to the configured endpoint            |
| `FUNNEL_AI_TIMEOUT`               | `45`                    | Generation request timeout in seconds            |
| `DEMO_MODE`                       | `false`                 | Enables the isolated guest sandbox               |
| `DEMO_LIFETIME_HOURS`             | `24`                    | Lifetime of guest sandbox accounts               |

Do not commit `.env` or expose AI, mail, database, or webhook credentials to the browser.
